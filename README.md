# Perfume
A Minecraft plugin that makes you feel pretty.
## To-do
- Fix /perfume command
- Increase radius (using GetHighestBlock()?)
- Random flower variety generator
- Add permissions
- Add other command options: particle type, flower type, set for a different player, block type (will have to use NMS and packet support)
- Check for more walk-through materials like under water, lava, place-down tools
